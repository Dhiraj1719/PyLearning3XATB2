'''
explain the difference between = and == operators:
[1] = (Assignment Operator):

Used to assign a value to a variable

Stores the value on the right side into the variable on the left side

== (Comparison/Equality Operator):

Used to compare two values or expressions
[2] Returns True if both sides are equal, False otherwise

Compares only the values, not the data types (in Python)

Use = when you want to assign/store values

Use == in conditional statements (if, while) to check equality

Use == in boolean expressions where you need to compare values

The ** operator in Python has two main uses:
[1]Exponentiation (Power) Operator:

Used to calculate powers/exponents [2]

Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand
